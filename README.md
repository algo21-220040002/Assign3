# Factor dispersion

Factor dispersion aims to calculate the factor dispersion and find the relationship between the factor dispersion and the factor's future performance. As I said in Assign2, the performance of factor is not stable and sometimes it's a vary good factor but sometimes it's a bad factor. So in Factor Dispersion I will calculate the factor dispersion and analyze the relationship between the factor dispersion and it's future's performance.

## Function Introduction

   * Calculate the future's ICIR of the factor 
       
       * In the main function you can calculate the ICIR and in my result I calculated the future's 12 months' ICIR.
     
   * Calculate the factor's dispersion

       * In the main function you can calculate the factor's dispersion and if you are interested in the formula of the factor dispersion you can read the paper.
      
   * Draw the picture of the analysis
  
       * In the main function if you run the reasearch funtion it will output the result including the picture and the corrlation and R square and so on.

## Environment Prepared

   * The version of python: 3.8
   * We recommed you to use pycharm. After you download it and you can use pycharm to run it

## Result

   Here I run the analysis of BP factor. From the result you can find that there is indeed relationship between the factor dispersion and its future's performance.
   When the factor dispersion is large in the future it tend to play an important role and can get good return.
   
   * The dispersion of BP factor.
